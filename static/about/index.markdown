Hi I'm Cody!

I'm a DevOps practitioner with almost a decade of IT operational experience, and a background in Computer Science through my undergraduate degree at Georgia Tech.

I specialize in Linux batch computing systems, with experience on both in-house systems and on Amazon Web Services. I have an interest in alerting and monitoring, as well as applying ideas from outside industries to tech.
